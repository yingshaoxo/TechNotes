# How to use Google API within Flutter

Well, at the beginning, I don't even know that we could use google's API to do a lot of things.

But here we go, we'll start to use it.

## A native way
https://developers.google.com/people/v1/libraries#java

## A flutter way
I refuse to use old tech.

So let's use flutter.

### 1. sign in
https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in/install

> Of cause you need to sign in if you want to handle some data of a google account

### 2. call the api
https://pub.dev/packages/googleapis

https://pub.dev/packages/extension_google_sign_in_as_googleapis_auth/example

Just try to follow the second link since it's the one that really works.
